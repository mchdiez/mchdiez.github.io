# Hello everyone!

I'm María, a Bioinformatics research engineer at the **[Barcelona Supercomputing Center](http://www.bsc.es/)** within the **[Spanish National Bioinformatics Institute](https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/scientific-structure/national-institute-bioinformatics-elixir-node-0)** coordination unit led by Salvador Capella-Gutierrez. I’m also a Bioinformatics and Biostatistics MSc student at the University of Barcelona and the Open University of Catalonia (now on my last semester!).

Right now, my work mainly focuses on the development of distributed computing research infrastructures and their application in areas such as personalized medicine. I’m also experienced in software development and really interested in the application of technological knowledge to the treatment of biological data.
